The new Fairfield Programming Association Standards website is built in Gatsby and uses Tailwind CSS for the styling. This enables us to keep down server costs while also providing an excellent user and developer experience. Most of our pages are DSG ([Deferred Static Generation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/)), which means that most of the information on the website can be changed by modifying the information inside of the data folder.
