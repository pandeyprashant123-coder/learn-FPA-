The new Fairfield Programming Association Learning website is built in Gatsby and uses Tailwind CSS for the styling. This enables us to keep down server costs while also providing an excellent user and developer experience. Most of our pages are DSG ([Deferred Static Generation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/)), which means that most of the information on the website can be changed by modifying the information inside of the data folder.

## Features

## Setup

1. Download the project from Github.

2. Have Node, NPM, and Gatsby installed.

3. Run the below command to install the packages.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the below command to start the website.

```bash
gatsby develop
```

**Note:** It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to start the website, but once the website is live, it does [hot reloading](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/local-development/fast-refresh/).
