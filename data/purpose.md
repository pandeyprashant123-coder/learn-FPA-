Most of the standards out there today are put together by groups that are run by boring old dudes. It's reflected in the standards that they produce tooâ€“ there is too much bureaucracy, outdated thinking, and inefficiencies, so we came forward to fix that.

## What Sets Us Apart?

All of the standards that we put forward are simple, innovative, and modular. We want any developer to be able to read one of our standards and understand it. But, every single one of our standards is still unique, detailed, solid, and modular. Modularity for us is one of the most important factors as it allows us to look to the future while maintaining our ability to pivot any of our technology.
