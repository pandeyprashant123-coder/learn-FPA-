## Who runs the Vault?

The official owner of the Vault is the Fairfield Programming Association, but is formally run by a team of wonderful engineers who are devoted to the open-source initiative. If you are interested in joining the team that runs the vault, please contact the team by following the directions on the [Vault Program page](https://about.fairfieldprogramming.org/programs/vault/).

## Rules of the Vault

1. The standard must be original, unpublished, and innovative.

We are not interested in publishing any standards that have already been published in other places, such as other standards bodies, in public papers, etc. We also do not want any standards that have been created as slightly modified versions of other standards, especially if the other standard was not published in the Vault.

2. The standard must be simple and concise.

We are not interested in publishing any standards that are long, drawn out, and overly complicated. We have a page limit of 40 pages– if your standard goes over this limit, you should split it into multiple standards. There is also the problem of boilerplate in many standards– we don't want boilerplate.

3. The standard should be modular.

All standards should be like Legos– simple, but with many, you can build intricate creations. Every standard published in the Vault must have a explicit purpose but its functionality should be vague enough that others can build on it with their own standards.
